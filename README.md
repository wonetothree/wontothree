Hi, This is Anthony Garcia (or Sewon Kim). I am a robotics engineer with a passion for developing AGI with Robotics. I am especially interested in robotics control using MPC and RL, and computer vision AI. I enjoy bringing mathematically sophisticated theories into reality, but I always strive to maintain a sense of balance between theory and implementation.

Outside of my career background, I’m from Seoul, South Korea. I’m passionate about jazz and hard metal music, and I enjoy playing both acoustic and electric guitar.
